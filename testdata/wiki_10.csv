29583022	Upper Enham  Upper Enham Formerly known as Upper Kings Enham, is a small Hamlet in the civil parish of Smannell lying along MacCallum Road between Little London and Enham Alamein in the Test Valley district of Hampshire, England. It lies 2.7 miles (4.4 km) north from Andover, its nearest town. According to Cambridge University the important meeting of 16 May 1008 was held at Kings Enham. This meeting of 40 Nobles including King Aethelred and Bishop Wulfstan with 350 retainers, put into draft a decree stating that England would now worship one Christian God, One King, and that all men would be subject to Law. This signified the rebirth of England and it is thought that the reference to Lambs being raised here is not a reference to livestock, but to the followers of God, "The Flock".

1345281	Tancredo Neves International Airport  Tancredo Neves/Confins International Airport (IATA: CNF, ICAO: SBCF), formerly called Confins International Airport, is the main airport serving Belo Horizonte and Metropolitan Area, Brazil, located in the adjoining municipality of Confins. Since 2 September 1986 the airport is named after Tancredo de Almeida Neves (1910–1985), President-elect of Brazil. It is operated by BH Airport S.A.. History. The airport was built by Infraero and inaugurated in 1984. Its purpose was to lessen the congestion at Pampulha Airport, which at the time was operating at 120% of its capacity of 1.3 million passengers per year. It was expected that by 1990, passenger movement at Confins would be nearly 2 million passengers per year. However, it surpassed the 1 million passenger mark only 22 years later. Presently its maximum operational capacity is 5 million passengers per year. After its inauguration, just a small fraction of the capacity of Confins was used. This was partly due to its distance from downtown Belo Horizonte and, until recently, to the lack of satisfactory transportation alternatives for the pricey (about USD40) taxi rides. The over-crowded Pampulha Airport remained the airport of choice. In order to revert this scenario, in March 2005 the government of the state of Minas Gerais with the support of agencies of the Federal government decided to restrict Pampulha to operations of aircraft with capacity of up to 50 passengers. In the months thereafter, most operations were forced to move to Confins and the airport gained a new momentum. At that time, 130 flights were transferred from Pampulha to Confins, increasing annual passenger flow from 350,000 to around 3.0 million that year. The problems related to the distance of Confins to downtown Belo Horizonte were lessened by recent projects such as the improvement of the highway that links the city center to the airport (MG-10 highway), part of a larger project called Linha Verde ("Green Line"), which seeks to reduce the time needed to reach the airport. Another project called the "Industrial Airport" in underway. In this project the government will exempt tax of businesses interested in settling their operations near the airport. Its cargo facilities have a capacity of handling 18.000 tones (39.682.000 lb) and the warehouse has 6.400 m² (68.889 ft²). The main maintenance facilities of Gol Airlines are located at this airport. On 26 April 2011 it was confirmed that in order to speed-up much needed renovation and up-grade works, private companies will be granted a concession to explore some Infraero airports among them, on a second phase, Confins. The plan was confirmed on 31 May 2011 and it was added that Infraero would retain 49% of the shares of each privatized airport and that negotioations are expected to be concluded on the first half of 2012. On 22 November 2013 the Brazilian Government had a bidding process to determine the operator of the airport from 2014 until 2044. The group BH Airport formed by CCR (75%) and the administrator of Munich and Zurich Airports (25%) won the competition. Future developments. On 31 August 2009, the previous concessionary, Infraero, unveiled a BRL342.3 million (USD180.3 million; EUR126.4 million) investment plan to up-grade Tancredo Neves International Airport focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The investiment was supposed to be distributed as follows: Presently, the extension of the runway and the renovation of the passenger terminal are still being implemented. Access. The airport is located 38 km north of downtown Belo Horizonte. It is regularly served by buses, taxis and Executive Airport Shuttle Buses. When using buses, transfer to the subway of Belo Horizonte is possible. Tickets are available at booths in the arrivals area.	'airport'	-19.6239	-43.9714
